# GreenHouse Monitoring System Documentation

## Overview
The GreenHouse Monitoring System is a Vue.js-based web application designed to monitor key greenhouse metrics such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light levels. It features a simple and user-friendly interface, allowi- ng authenticated users to access real-time data simulated through a mock API.

## Features
- Public Home Page: An introductory page accessible to all users.
- Authentication: Login and signup pages to ensure secure access to the dashboard.
- Dashboard: Displays real-time metrics related to the greenhouse environment.
- Simulated Data: Mock API to simulate dynamic updates for greenhouse parameters.
- Responsive Design: Adaptable to various screen sizes using modern styling tools.

## How It Works
1. Home Page:
   Users start on the home page, where they can navigate to the login or signup pages.
   
2. Authentication:
   Users provide their credentials (e.g., username and password) to log in. Upon successful authentication, they are redirected to the dashboard.
   
3. Authenticated users view real-time updates of:
   - Temperature (Â°C)
   - Humidity (%)
   - Soil Moisture (%)
   - Light Level (lux)
     These metrics are simulated using a mock API or dynamically generated in the application.
4. Data Updates:
   Metrics are updated every few seconds to simulate real-time behavior.
